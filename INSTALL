Installing pgAdmin from source
==============================

This document describes how to build pgAdmin from source on *nix, Mac and 
Windows.

Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and other unix variants
-----------------------------------------------

You will need:

- A modern development environment: 

    - GTK 2.2 or above.
    - GNU automake 1.9 or above.
    - GNU autoconf 2.59 or above.
    - GNU gcc 3.4 or above.

- wxGTK 2.8.x from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
- libxml2 2.6.18 or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- libxslt 1.1.x or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- PostgreSQL 8.4 or above from http://www.postgresql.org/
- Sphinx 1.0 or above from http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

Building:

1) Install libxml2 and libxslt if they are not already present on your system, 
   per the instructions included with them.
   
2) Install PostgreSQL per the instructions included. It is recommended that you
   build with OpenSSL support, using the --with-openssl configure option.
   
3) Unpack the wxGTK tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it
   as follows:
   
     cd /path/to/wxGTK/source/
     ./configure --with-gtk --enable-gtk2 --enable-unicode
     make
     sudo make install

     # Install wxWidgets contrib modules.
     cd contrib/
     make
     sudo make install
	
   A script is included in the pgAdmin source tarball 
   (xtra/wx-build/build-wxgtk) which will build and install wxWidgets in each 
   combination of shared/static/debug/release builds for you.
   
4) Unpack the pgAdmin tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it 
   as follows:
   
     bash bootstrap	# Required only if building from a GIT checkout
     ./configure
     make all
     sudo make install
	 
   If any of the prerequisite components are installed in locations that the 
   configure script cannot find, you may specify their locations on the command
   line. See the configure help (./configure --help) for details.

     
   
Mac OS X
--------

You will need:

- A modern development environment: 

    - XCode 2.0 or above
    - GNU automake 1.9 or above.
    - GNU autoconf 2.59 or above.

- wxMac 2.8.x from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
- libxml2 2.6.18 or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- libxslt 1.1.x or above from http://www.xmlsoft.org/
- PostgreSQL 8.4 or above from http://www.postgresql.org/
- Sphinx 1.0 or above from http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

Building:

1) Install libxml2 and libxslt per the instructions included with them into a 
   non-system location. The default versions included with OS X Panther and 
   Tiger are too old and will not work correctly with pgAdmin.
   
2) Install PostgreSQL per the instructions included. It is recommended that you
   build with OpenSSL support, using the --with-openssl configure option.
   
3) Unpack the wxMac tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it
   as follows:
   
     cd /path/to/wxMac/source/
     ./configure --with-mac --enable-gtk2 --enable-unicode
     make
     sudo make install

     # Install wxWidgets contrib modules.
     cd contrib/
     make
     sudo make install
	
   Note: You may also pass the --enable-universal_binary option to configure to
   build a Universal binary. This will also require a Universal build of 
   PostgreSQL's libpq library.
   
   A script is included in the pgAdmin source tarball 
   (xtra/wx-build/build-wxmac) which will install a Universal build ofwxWidgets 
   in each combination of shared/static/debug/release builds for you.
   
4) Unpack the pgAdmin tarball to a convenient location, and build and install it 
   as follows:
   
     bash bootstrap	# Required only if building from a GIT checkout
     ./configure --enable-appbundle
     make all
     make install
	 
   This final step will build an OSX appbundle called pgAdmin3.app in the root 
   of your source tree. As this can take a minute or two, the 
   pkg/mac/debug-bundle.sh script may be used to build a non-relocatable 'fake' 
   appbundle using symbolic links directly to the executable files. This 
   appbundle is called pgAdmin3-debug.app, and doesn't need to be rebuilt when 
   pgAdmin is recompiled.
   
   If any of the prerequisite components are installed in locations that the 
   configure script cannot find, you may specify their locations on the command
   line. See the configure help (./configure --help) for details.

4) After building pgAdmin, you will need to build an application bundle in
   order to launch the application.  One way to do this is to execute the
   script pkg/mac/debug-bundle.sh; you can then launch pgAdmin using the open
   command (e.g. open pgAdmin3-Debug.app).
   
Windows
-------

You will need:

- Windows 10 or above.
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2019.
- The Windows 10 Platform SDK.
- WiX toolset v3 from https://wixtoolset.org/
- wxMSW 3.0.5 or above from http://www.wxwidgets.org/
  If you only want to build the pgAdmin3 binary you need the packages
   - Header Files
   - Development Files
   - Release DLLs
  If you want to build the documentation and/or the installer you additionally
  need the package "Source Code".
- PostgreSQL 9.2.24 (binary distribution) from http://www.postgresql.org/
- PostgreSQL 10.19 or later (binary distribution) from http://www.postgresql.org/
- Sphinx 1.0 or above from http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
- Microsoft HTML Help Workshop

Building:

1) Unpack the wxMSW packages to a convenient location pointed to by the 
   %WXWIN% environment variable.

2) If you later want to build the pgAdmin3 documentation/installer you
   need to build the tool "hhp2cached":
   - Open a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
   - Navigate to %WXWIN%\utils\hhp2cached\
   - Run
       echo SHARED = 1 >> ..\..\build\msw\config.vc
       echo BUILD = release>> ..\..\build\msw\config.vc
       nmake -f makefile.vc COMPILER_VERSION=142

3) Install PostgreSQL 9.2.24 to a convenient location pointed to by the %PGDIR%
   environment variable.
   
4) Unpack the pgAdmin source code to a convenient location.

5) Start Visual C++ and load the pgAdmin solution file. Build the required 
   targets.

6) To run the resulting executable, you'll need to copy all of the
   prerequisite DLLs from the wxWidgets and PostgreSQL installations into the
   directory where the EXE file is located, or have those directories in your
   path.
   To actually connect to a Postgres-Server higher than 11 that is using SCRAM-
   authentication you need the "libpq.dll" from the Postgres 10.19 (or later)
   package.
